The package you will receive after download consists of following folders:

documentation: Available to View Online.
ios: workspace folder compatible with Xcode 12.4+
android: Android studio 4.1.0+ workspace
server: Backend APIs in an encrypted format.
iOS & android apps are in same development source code of demo except server app. Server App is a value added part of item and it is included in package but in an encrypted/compiled format so you won’t be able to edit current APIs from backend side. This doesn’t limits UI changes user might intend to make into app (including icons, colors, texts & etc). If you are interested in accessing to backend source code too you can contact minimalistic.apps@gmail.com to discuss it’s purchase.

# Requirements
A VPS (preferably with Ubuntu 16.04 or CentOS7). You can get one of these for a price low as 5$/month. For recommendations contact through email.
A Google Maps account with billing enabled which would cover low scale free of charges but could have costs to be paid for Google Maps services if your scale goes high.
Support
Codecanyon Mobile app authors are exempted from offering support on their item. That is understandable because mobile apps are source codes and being able to use/customize them require prior experience with development. Nonetheless Ridy on it’s own has some support offerings. All of the buyers would have access to an exclusive customer panel support.ridy.io with premium support (Free & Paid) and ability to order services they might require. This includes installation and customization such as implementation of payment gateways.

Supported Payment Gateways (Extended license required to use)
Below are the list of already integrated payment gateways into the solution. Using these are as easy as getting your API key from them and entering them in the Admin Panel

PayPal

PayGate
Paytm

Way For Pay
There is also a custom link option that you can use to redirect to your own backend and run the integration from there. This is useful for mobile payment guidance for example.
